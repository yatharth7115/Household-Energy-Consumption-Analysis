# Household-Energy-Consumption-Clustering Analysis

This project analyzes clustering techniques applied to various datasets to uncover hidden patterns and group similar data points. The analysis explores different clustering methods and evaluates their effectiveness in identifying meaningful clusters.  

## Features  
- Preprocessing and feature scaling for better clustering performance  
- Implementation of clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering  
- Visualization of cluster formations and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Evaluation of clustering quality using appropriate metrics  

## Dataset  
The analysis is conducted on publicly available datasets, ensuring a real-world application of clustering techniques. Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction for improved results.  

## Usage  
The Jupyter Notebook provides step-by-step implementation details. Running the notebook will execute the clustering models and generate visualizations to interpret the results effectively.  

## Results  
The project highlights how different clustering algorithms perform on structured datasets, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of each method. Visualizations help in understanding how clusters are formed and how well they separate different data points.  

## Contributing  
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or additional clustering techniques to explore, feel free to contribute.
